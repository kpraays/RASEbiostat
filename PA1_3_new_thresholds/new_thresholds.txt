PA 1: new MVPA1 throushold is 100mg, instead of our original 125
	: new MVPA2 threshold is 150mg
 
PA2: is done (already)

PA3: apply the same thresholds on L2 norm using x,y,z
PA3: we used x-axis for thesholding, now apply thesholding using combined x,y,z
Combine them using L2 norm as follows: sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + Z^2)
Apply same thresholds on L2 norm

Needed to get upto speed on codebase.
 
Beluga will not be working till Jan 31 but we have alternatives. I used Narval to run our calculations using UK BioBank dataset.
